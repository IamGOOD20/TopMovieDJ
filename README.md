Hello community!
## **Summary**

Finally I found out about Django and Rest Framework. I think it's time to implement a project that I like.
And so, I already did the project https://github.com/IamGOOD20/Top-movies-2022-2000, the code reads information from the site and returns an HLS file with the name of the movies, year of release, ratings, etc., starting from 2000. The rating of film critics is the priority in the selection of films. Why he? Because there you can find great films about which you will not see advertisements. It's all)

## **What is to be done?**
1. Make a full-fledged application site with data. For now, I only want to create a catalog, no online views or downloads.
2. Add user registration
3. Add the ability to sort by all key parameters.
  4. Wrap everything in a beautiful template. 3 options:
- find a ready-made template, which is not entirely interesting
- find on LinkedIN a beginner Java script developer who wants to participate in a joint project.
- turn to a friend who is always very busy, because unlike me, he has been working as a developer for a long time

## **What I don't know is what tasks are to be solved?**
1. I will take my code from the previous project, but it does not read the photo, I need to finish it.
2. You need to put everything in one project (collection, storage, display), you need to take into account that the ranges change and new ones are added, that is, you may need to create several applications in the project.
3. How to parse photos?
4. How to collect information and put it into the database.

Probably enough))
Already impatient to transgress, with God!
